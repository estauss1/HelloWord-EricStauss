    <h1>About Eric Stauss</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Eric Stauss and I'm a senior computer science 
    student at Kent State University. I have an interest in game 
    programming and aspire to one day work at a game studio.
    </p>
    <p>I've learned a lot about programming and computers over the last three and 
    a half years both inside and outside of class. Some of the things I've learned 
    include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Programming languages such as C++, C#, Javascript, Swift, and Lua. Most 
      of my experience has been in C++ because that is the main language used in the 
      Kent State University cirriculum.</li>
      <li>IOS development from taking IOS Programming class</li>
      <li>How to create games using different game engines. Primarily have knowledge 
      with Unity, but also dabbled in Unreal Engine.</li>
      <li>How to work on a software project with a team. Created a web-based video game 
      with 11 other people. Also created a top-down space exploration game in unity with 
      3 other people.</li>
      <li>Website Development</li>
      <li>How computers function at a low level</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Other Interests</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Asside from the software and programming side of things, I 
        enjoy messing around with hardware as well. I like building computers 
        and have built cryptocurrency mining stuff as a hobby. I recently built 
        and soldered a keyboard called a dactyl manuform (pictured below).

      <li><p>I enjoy snowboarding a lot. One of my fondest memories
        was going to Keystone Colorado and being able to snowboard on 
        some giant mountains. I hope to revisit someday.</p></li>
      <li><p>I like playing video games. Most of my favorite video game 
        titles are first person shooter games. My favorite at the moment
        is called Escape From Tarkov, but it has it's issues.</p></li>
      <li><p>Spending time with my family and dogs.</p></li>
    </ul>
